You can run this sample project independently to debug issues. You will need to be in the filtered output directory, not
the source directory (usually `target/test-classes/projects/happy-farm-processed`)

Use

```bash
mvn verify
```

or, for continuous testing and dev mode,

```bash
mvn quarkus:dev
```
